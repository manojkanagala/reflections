1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialise a repositiory .git file will be added and creates a repository with a specified address. We need the repositiory to commit the files that we made changes and keep the application as a whole.

2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is in between the working Directory and the Repository. Staging area is the place where individula files can be added before committing them to the Repository. It is gives user a flexibility to add individual tasks  to the staging area and commits as a whole to the repositiory as per how the user feels to commit.
